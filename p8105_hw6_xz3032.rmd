## Problem 1
```{r}
homicide_df = 
  read_csv("data/homicide-data.csv", na = c("", "NA", "Unknown")) %>%
  mutate(
    city_state = str_c(city, state, sep = ","),
    victim_age = as.numeric(victim_age),
    resolution = case_when(
      disposition == "Closed without arrest" ~0,
      disposition == "Open/No arrest"        ~0,
      disposition == "Closed by arrest"       ~1)) %>%
  filter(city_state != "Tulsa, AL") %>%
  select(city_state, resolution, victim_age, victim_race, victim_sex)
```

Start with one city
```{r}
baltimore_df = 
  homicide_df %>%
  filter(city_state == "Baltimore, MD")
```
